## Questions

**Question**: *What is needed to ensure that a URI resolves differently when on the internal company network
vs external (public) browsing? *

The de-refernced public URI must only provide publicly available information,
while the interal deferencing yields company confidential information in addition to the public content.

Ideally, a single URI deferences differently based on context (internal vs external).
